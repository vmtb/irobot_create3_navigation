# Mobile Robot Create 3

This project demonstrates how to control the iRobot Create 3 robot using the [iRobot Python SDK](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk) via Bluetooth.

## Features

1. **Obstacle Avoidance (Ã‰vitement d'Obstacles)**

   - Implemented in the `mission` file.
   - The robot can detect and avoid obstacles by navigating around them in a rectangular pattern.

2. **Bumper Touch (Aller-Retour)**

   - Implemented in the `bumper_touch.py` file.
   - The robot moves back and forth, responding to bumper touch events.

3. **Custom Sensor Management**

   - A custom `SensorIr` class is used to manage the relationship between sensor states and obstacles.

4. **Autonomous Movement + Obstacle Detection**
   - Demonstrated in the `autonomous.py` file.
   - The robot moves autonomously while detecting and avoiding obstacles.
